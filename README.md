# Game Demo

This is a game demo project.

## What's new?

- Added character and animation to game demo.
- Used Getx for state managing including Getx controller for player, player state and bindings to bind controllers to pages.
- Used clean architect for clean code structure including layers like data, domain, presentation.

## Conclusion

After spending a day learning and applying brand new technologies to this base project, I've learned a lot. This project is based on a self-taught process, so I hope you won't be too critical of it.
